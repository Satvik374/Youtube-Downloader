# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming and dark mode support
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation resolvers

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations and schema management
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx and Vite integration in development mode

## Data Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Schema**: 
  - Download history table for tracking user downloads
  - Users table for authentication (prepared but not fully implemented)
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and API validation
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for cloud deployment

## Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend compilation
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration across client, server, and shared code
- **Code Organization**: Monorepo structure with shared schemas and types
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

## API Design
- **Architecture**: RESTful API with consistent error handling
- **Endpoints**: CRUD operations for download history management
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation on API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging**: Request/response logging with performance metrics

## UI/UX Design
- **Design System**: Consistent component library with Radix UI accessibility
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode toggle with CSS custom properties
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for actions and errors
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress visualization

# External Dependencies

## Database & Cloud Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting with connection pooling
- **WebSocket Support**: For real-time database connections via ws package

## UI Component Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI primitives for accessibility and keyboard navigation
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Embla Carousel**: Carousel/slider component for media display
- **React Day Picker**: Date selection components

## Development & Build Tools
- **Vite Plugins**: 
  - React plugin for JSX transformation
  - Runtime error overlay for development
  - Cartographer plugin for Replit integration
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind and Autoprefixer
- **Class Variance Authority**: Utility for component variant management

## Utility Libraries
